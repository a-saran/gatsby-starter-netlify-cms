---

It's been 10 years since [jQuery][1] started ruling the web and it has stuck around for good reasons. After a long time jQuery got a major update last month with the release of jQuery 3.0 and jQuery Compat 3.0. This release promises a slimmer and faster jQuery, with backwards compatibility in mind. You can download the latest jQuery 3.0 from the [download page][2]. It's also worth having a look at the [upgrade guide][3] and the [source code][4].

In this article, I'm going to highlight the new important changes introduced inside jQuery 3.0 and how you can use it.

 

#### 1\. jQuery 3.0 runs in Strict Mode

Today almost all browsers supported by jQuery 3 support [strict mode][5], this release have been built with this directive in mind.

![jquery-strict][6]

Got your code running in non strict mode? No worries, You don't need to rewrite your existing jQuery code. Although jQuery 3 has been written in strict mode, it's not compulsory to run your code in strict mode. Strict & non-strict mode JavaScript can happily coexist.

#### 2\. Forâ€¦of Loop

jQuery 3.0 supports the `forâ€¦of` statement, a new kind of `for` loop. This new iterator is part of the [ECMAScript 6][8]. It gives a more straightforward way to loop over iterable objects, such as Arrays, Maps, and Sets. In jQuery 3.0, the `for...of` loop can replace the former `$.each(...)` syntax.
    
    
    var items = $('.random-class');
    
    // old jQuery way
    $.each(items, function(index, value) {
     // do something
    });
    
    // ES6 way
    for(let item of items) {
     // do something
    };
    

_Note: The `for...of` loop will only work with browsers that supports ECMAScript 6 or if you use a JavaScript compiler such as [Babel][9]._

 

#### 3\. requestAnimationFrame( ) for Animations

jQuery 3.0 uses the `requestAnimationFrame()` API for animations. It makes animations run smoother, faster and less CPU-intensive animations. This new API is only used in browsers that [support][10] it. For older browsers (i.e. IE9), it uses previous API as a fallback method to display animations. If you want to learn more about **RequestAnimationFrame**, you can refer this good [blog post][11].

#### 4\. escapeSelector( ) for Escaping Strings with special meaning

The new `$.escapeSelector()` method allows you to escape strings or characters that mean something else in CSS selector. This method is useful for situations where a class name or an ID contains characters that have a special meaning in CSS, such as the dot or semicolon. It's not a frequent occurring issue, but if you get into a problem like this, now you have an easy way to fix it.
    
    
    //consider this is your element
    

    
    //above element can't be selected like this because the selector is parsed as "an element with id 'abc' that also has a class 'def'.
    $('#abc.def')
    
    //with jQuery 3.0 it can be selected like this
    $( '#' + $.escapeSelector( 'abc.def' ) )
    

 

#### 5\. Additional Protection against XSS Attacks

jQuery 3.0 added an extra security layer for protection against [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)][13] attacks. It requires developers to specify `dataType: 'script'` in the options of `$.ajax()` and `$.get()` methods. In other words, While making a request for a script on a domain other than the one that hosts the document, you must now explicitly declare this in the options.

> _Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks are a type of injection, in which malicious scripts are injected into otherwise benign and trusted web sites. XSS attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code, generally in the form of a browser side script, to a different end user. Flaws that allow these attacks to succeed are quite widespread and occur anywhere a web application uses input from a user within the output it generates without validating or encoding it._

 

#### 6\. Removed special-case deferred methods in .ajax( )

The `jqXHR` object returned from $.ajax( ) is a `Deferred`. Previously, It had three extra methods with names matching the arguments object of `success`, `error` and `complete`. In jQuery 3.0 these methods have been removed. Now you can use the `Deferred` standard methods of `done`, `fail` and `always` or you can use the new `then` and `catch` methods.

 

#### 6\. New signature for .get( ) AND .post( )

jQuery 3.0 adds a new signature for the $.get( ) and the $.post( ) functions by adding a `settings` parameter to align them to $.ajax( ). It's an object that can possess many properties and its the same object that you can provide to $.ajax( ). The only difference when passing the same `settings` object to $.get() and $.post() as opposed to $.ajax() is that the method `property` is always ignored.
    
    
    //HTTP Get
    $.get([settings])
    
    //HTTP Post
    $.post([settings])
    

 

#### 7\. Class Manipulation Methods Support SVG

jQuery never fully supported SVG and this hasn't changed in jQuery 3.0. The jQuery methods that manipulate CSS class names, such as `.addClass()` and `.hasClass()` can now be used to manipulate SVG documents as well. This means you can find classes with jQuery in SVG and then style the classes with CSS.

 

#### 8\. Easy Show/Hide Logic

This is one important change that you should should remember. From now on, the `.show()`, `.hide()` and `.toggle()` methods will focus on inline styles rather than computed styles. The docs asserts that the most important result will be:

> _As a result, disconnected elements are no longer considered hidden unless they have inline display: none;, and therefore .toggle() will no longer differentiate them from connected elements as of jQuery 3.0._

If you want to understand the results of the new show/hide logic in more better way, you can refer this [table][14] created by jQuery team or read this interesting [Github discussion][15] about it.

 

#### 9\. Decimal values by .width ( ) and .height ( )

jQuery used to return round values with `width()`, `height()` and all the other related methods. jQuery 3.0 fixes that and you'll get more accurate result (i.e. a floating number). This is a very good improvement, as sometimes, users do require the exact values when they use these for a layout.

 

#### 10\. Deprecation of .bind() and .delegate() methods

jQuery 1.7 introduced the `.on()` method for attaching event handlers. jQuery 3.0 deprecated `.bind()`, `.unbind()`, `.delegate()` and `.undelegate()` methods and these methods might be removed completely in future releases. You can use `on()` and `off()` methods for all your projects, so you don't have to worry about future releases.

 

#### Conclusion

Many people consider that jQuery is dead and doesn't have a place in modern web. However, its development continues and statistics of its adoption (78.5% in the top million) contradict these claims.
